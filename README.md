# MetaRasterGrid

Script to make polygons of raster files spatial coverage, using meta files (here tif.xml). 

Why? If you have 100s of GB of raster files on a server and meta data is given in xml-files, then you dont need to download all raster files to get an overview of coverage, and it is easier to locate the raster file(s) that covers the area of interest.
